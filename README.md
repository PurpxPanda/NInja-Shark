# Horiseon Code Refactor
## Code refactor for bootcamp Module 1.

-My motivation was to make the code cleaner and easier to read then when i found it.
-I built this project to make the website more accessible for those using screen readers and other accessibility functions, it also optimizes the code for search engines.
-I learned how to use semantic elements correctly and how to clean up already written code.
